This challenge is focusing around the ability to write proper unit tests.

In the src directory you'll find some basic functions that manipulate date.

Your goal for this challenge is to write tests that cover the 3 functions inside of the ./challenge_1/src/transformations.py file

You can run your tests by using pipenv and the following command

`pipenv run challenge_1`

which will show you the results of your tests.

It's up to you how many tests to write, what edge cases, success and failure cases to write.

When you've completed the challenge, please create a pull request in this code repository with your submission.
You should name your branch with the following pattern:

challengeSubmission/{lastName}

Good luck!
