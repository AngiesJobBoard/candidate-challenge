This challenge is focusing around the ability to write proper unit tests.

In the src directory you'll find some basic functions that get, model, and manipulate date.

Your goal for this challenge is to write tests that cover all functions inside of the ./challenge_1/src/transformations.py file
without needing to call or use any external dependencies. (This means your code should run without an internet connection!)

You can run your tests by using pipenv and the following command

`pipenv run challenge_1`

which will show you the results of your tests.

It's up to you how many tests to write, what edge cases, success and failure cases to write.

When you've completed the challenge, please email the link to your forked repository back to 

`mike@shancorps.com`

You should name your branch with the following pattern:

challengeSubmission/{lastName}

Good luck!
