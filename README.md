These challenges are used to evaluate potential candidates for contributing to Angie's Job Board.

You will be assigned individual challenges by your interviewer and will only need to complete the challenges assigned to you.

For each challenge, you should find all relevant source material and challenge requirements within those directories above.

Each of these challenges will use Pipenv to handle your virtual environment and running the challenge cases.
You can install pipenv with the following command

`pip install pipenv`

or alternatively

`python3 -m pip install pipenv`

Then you can run your challenge case with

`pipenv run {challenge}` such as pipenv run challenge_1
